    "In this lab you will first learn the following code snippet which is a simple web spider class that allows you to scrape paginated webpages. Read the code, run it, and make sure you understand how it work. In the challenges of this lab, we will guide you in building up this class so that eventually you will have a more robus web spider that you can further work on in the Web Scraping Project."
